## What is TNoodle

TNoodle is a software suite that contains the official WCA scramble program. It generates scrambles for competitions.

## WCA Scramble Program

The official scramble program for the [World Cube Association](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/) has been part of the TNoodle project since January 1, 2013. It will contain the sole official scramble program for the foreseeable future.

All WCA official competitions must always use the current version of the official scramble program. This is available from <https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/scrambles/>

Note that only the scramble program part of TNoodle is "official". Other TNoodle projects may be convenient for certain uses (including at official competitions), but do not have any official status.

### "Scramble Program" vs. "Scrambler"

Officially, `TNoodle-WCA` is a [scramble program](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#4f), while a [scrambler](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#A2b) is a human. It is fine to refer to TNoodle as a "scrambler" colloquially, but please try to use the official convention wherever possible.
